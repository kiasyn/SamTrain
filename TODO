[FUTURE] group - add group to each type of station, trains will only be used between their groups (so you can stop trains travelling the whole map)
[FUTURE] add warning if train has been waiting at depot for fuel for 2 mins?
[FUTURE] add warning if train has been waiting at supplier for configurable timer
[FUTURE] add warning if train has been waiting at consumer for configurable timer
[FUTURE] support multiple forces?
[FUTURE] add timeout to consumer/supplier to add to scheduling?
[FUTURE] graphics
[FUTURE] PATTERN MATCH Locomotive / Cargo / Fluid wagons
[FUTURE] make resource show over train stop on alt mode - this is very hard, "you could maybe place an hidden logistic chest, and change the icon" and "Constant combinator is probably preferable, since it wonâ€™t try to connect to the logistic network."
[FUTURE] make resource show on map?
[FUTURE] if a train is on the way to the depot but still fairly fueled, just dispatch it from wherever it is?
[FUTURE] Automatically refresh trainstop gui if it changes?
[FUTURE] move config defaults to mod settings?

[DONE] make it so you can replace an existing train stop [fast_replaceable_group ?]
[FIXED] fix dumb bug where resources are done in alphabetical order?
[DONE] add mod_init for adding mod to an existing save
[WONT DO] conductor to skip over errored stops
[FIXED] fix dumb bug where trains are overallocated?
[DONE] handle train creation / modification / deletion
[DONE] handle train stops with duplicate names (logic written to error stop in add_train_stop)
[DONE] we need to track all train stops (even not ours) for duplicate names
[DONE] handle fluid trains 
[DONE] handle enabled flag or remove it
[DONE] some sort of magic for detecting a resource in a train in a depot and sending it somewhere it needs to go
[DONE] priority system - order by priority, then by lowest number of assigned trains
[DONE] copy settings when shift click?
[DONE] round robin to make sure all stops get trains
[DONE] Only dispatch trains set to automatic
[DONE] color trains / based on dest stop?
[DONE] Fix science
[DONE] Fix material costs
[DONE] trains gui (listing trains, consumer, destination, location, number of assigned trains to stop, max number of trains?)
[DONE] train_stop passed to gui needs to be somethign ebtter than what it is
[DONE] tidy up train stop gui
[DONE] merge event handlers into events or whatever
[WONT DO] debug log for a consumer?
[DONE] add valid checks on all entiteis
[FIXED] Fix disabling not working
[DONE] make trains wait at depot until fueled
[FIXED] copy pasting train stop name didn't give train stop warning
[NOT BUG] Placing blueprint didn't detect duplicate train stop name - it was just infinity mode breaking
[NOT BUG] Clicking blueprinted consumer didn't open train stop gui - it was just infinity mode breaking
[CANT FIX] Adding a depot over the top of where a train is does not seem to add that train to trains_at_depot - Can't detect a train if we place a stop
[DONE] Automatically refresh overview gui if it changes
[DONE] fix locale file
[DONE] Click on train or stop in overview to be taken to it
[DONE] Removing stop removes from suppliers/consumers/train_stops/gui - this seems fine
